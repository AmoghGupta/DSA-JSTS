shortest JS program is an empty JS file.
A GLOBAL EXECUTION CONTEXT is still created even if there is nothing to execute.
WINDOW object and all other global variables are created in global EXECUTION context so that you can access them any where. JS engine does
all this for us.

JS also gives us "this" which points to the current execution context. by default this "this" points to window object.


this == window
// return true


every browser has its own engine.. for example chrome has v8... all engines create this global variable.


whenever an execution context is created.. a "this" is created for it.. 

any code we write gets attached to the global space:
for example:
var a=10;
function b(){
    //
}
window.a will give u 10
window.b will give u the complete function

this.a will give u 10
this.b will give u the complete function
