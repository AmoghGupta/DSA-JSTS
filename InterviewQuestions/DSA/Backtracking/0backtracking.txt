ABC = 3! = 6 possible ways to arrangements

ABC
ACB
BAC
BCA
CAB
CBA

SIMILARY IF ABCD then 4! are the all possible arrangements


// whenever you are taking out all possible arrangements using recursion
// in those questions backtracking is used

// A backtracking algorithm is a problem-solving algorithm that uses a brute force approach for finding the desired output. 
// The Brute force approach tries out all the possible solutions and chooses the desired/best solutions.
