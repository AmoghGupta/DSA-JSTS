// Intersection Observer is a JavaScript feature that allows you to detect when an element becomes visible on the screen or 
// enters a particular area on the page.

// This can be used to do things like lazy-load images, which means that the image is only loaded when it's actually visible on the screen, 
// instead of all at once when the page loads.

// Let's say you have an image on your website that's further down the page, and you want to only load it when the user scrolls down to 
// that part of the page. You would use Intersection Observer to detect when the user has scrolled down far enough to see the image,
// and then load the image at that point.
