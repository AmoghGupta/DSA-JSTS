// (right shift) Takes two numbers, right shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of 
// places to shift.Similarly right shifting (x>>y) is equivalent to dividing x with 2^y. 


//logic is x/2^y

const a = 16;         
const b = 3;         

console.log(a >> b); // 16/2^3
