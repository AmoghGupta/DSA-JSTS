// The command pattern is useful in cases when we want to decouple objects executing the commands from objects issuing the commands. 
// For example, imagine a scenario where our application is using a large number of API service calls. Then, letâ€™s say that the API services change. 
// We would have to modify the code wherever the APIs that changed are called.

// This would be a great place to implement an abstraction layer, which would separate the objects calling an API service from the objects 
// which are telling them when to call the API service. 



// the object which knows how to execute the command
var invoker = {
    add: function(x, y) {
        return x + y;
    },
    subtract: function(x, y) {
        return x - y;
    }
}

// the object which is used as an abstraction layer when
// executing commands; it represents an interface
// toward the invoker object
var manager = {
    execute: function(name, ...args) {
        if (name in invoker) {
            return invoker[name].apply(invoker, args);
        }
        return false;
    }
}

// prints 8
console.log(manager.execute("add", 3, 5));
// prints 2
console.log(manager.execute("subtract", 5, 3));
