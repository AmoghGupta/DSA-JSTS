console.log(a); // "a" not accesible without initialization
 
let a  = 10;

var b = 100;

// execution context again comes to picture
// even before code execution, for 'b' a memory is allocated with "undefined" in global space
// but for "a" since its a let statement a memory is allocated with "undefined" but not in global space
// but in a different memory 'Script' where 'a' is not accessible
// hence we get an error cannot access 'a' before initialization.
// temporal dead zone: this is the time when 'a' has not been initialized and also is not accesible since its locked.
// after initialization 'a' becomes accesible and is moved to a memory where its accesible (not in globalspace hence window.a wont work).
// let variables cannot be redeclared

// with const also all the above holds true
// let is strict and const is stricter
// you cannot reassign a const variable
