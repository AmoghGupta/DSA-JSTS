How are recursion problems thought/solved and coded?

// 1. base case ==> simplest possible input for this function
// 2. find relation ==> how the larger problem can be solved with the help of the solution of the smaller problem
// 3. generalise - put all this in a mathematical function or tree.



1. base condition - base condition is represented by answers we already have
2. break it down to simpler problem 
3. generalise- recurrence relation.


1. identify if you can break down the problem into smaller problem
2. write the recurrence relation if needed
3. draw the recursive tree
4. about the tree:
    a. see the flow of functions, how they are getting in stack
    b. idenfity and focus on left tree calls and right tree calls
    c. draw the tree and pointers again and again using pen/paper
    d. use a debugger to see the flow
5. 
    a. See how the values are returned at each step
    b. See wheere the function call will come out
    c. in the end you will come out of the main.
