Hoisting is totally related to execution context logic i.e the memory allocation and code execution phase.


=======================================================================================
getName(); //hello world
console.log(x); //undefined
console.log(getName); //Æ’ getName(){console.log("hello world");}

var x= 7;
function getName(){
    console.log("hello world");
}

=======================================================================================
explanation: 
when this code starts executing, getName function is already in memory (bcuz of memory allocatoin phase)
but x has been assigned undefined before (bcuz of memory allocatoin phase), so at line 7
function gets executed and result is printed. 
line8: x is undefined till now so undefined is printed.
line 9: function is printed as is(we are not invoking the function, just printing)
line11: now x is assigned 7
