// shadowing in JS

let b =100;
{
    var a =10;
    let b =20;
    const c = 30;
    console.log(a);
    console.log(b);
    console.log(c);
}

console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);


// 10,20,30,100

// here let is used, so b present outside (global scope) and b present inside (local scope) point to different scopes..
// thats why let is block scoped
