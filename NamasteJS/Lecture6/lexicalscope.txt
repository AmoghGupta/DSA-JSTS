// lexical meaning in hierachy or in order.
// JS follows lexical scoping
// lexical scoping is also related to execution context only.
// whenever an execution context is created automatically lexical scoping is created.
// each execution context maintains a lexical environment memory also i.e its parent container.

// a variable is first searched in its own execution context and if not found then its parents execution context and so on
// this is also called scope chain. JS engine traverses lexically in scope chain.
