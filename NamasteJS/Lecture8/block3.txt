// shadowing in JS

var a =100;
{
    var a =10;
    let b =20;
    const c = 30;
    console.log(a);
    console.log(b);
    console.log(c);
}

console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);

// a is present in global scope
// here "a" is getting overshadowed by the block level scoped "a" variable because they both point to the same global scope
// O/p is 10,20,30,10
