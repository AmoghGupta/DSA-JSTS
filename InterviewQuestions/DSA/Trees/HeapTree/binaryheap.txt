How is Binary Heap represented?
A Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree.
A binary heap is typically represented as an array.

The traversal method use to achieve Array representation is LEVEL ORDER TRAVERSAL.

Please note: this is applicable only for Binary Heaps:

1. ROOT: N=0
2. PARENT NODE: parent = floor((N - 1)/2)
3. LEFT CHILD: 2N+1
4. RIGHT CHILD: 2N+2

USAGE: Access the min/max value: O(1)
Heaps is primarily used for getting the minimum or the maximum value present in a heap in O(1) time.
The linear data structures like Arrays or LinkedList can get you this value in O(n) time,
while non-linear data structures like Binary Search Trees(BST) can get you this value in O(log n) time where n is the number of elements.

Application:
Heap Sort uses Binary Heap to sort an array in O(nLogn) time
