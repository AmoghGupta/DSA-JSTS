Full Binary Tree
// A full Binary tree - in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children.


Perfect Binary Tree
// in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.


Complete Binary Tree:
// is a full binary tree, but with two major differences
    // Every level must be completely filled
    // All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.
    // The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. a complete binary tree doesn't have to be a full binary tree.

Skewed Binary Tree:
// A skewed binary tree is a tree in which the tree is either 
// dominated by the left nodes or the right nodes. Thus, there are two types of skewed binary tree:
// left-skewed binary tree and right-skewed binary tree.

Balanced Binary Tree:
// It is a type of binary tree in which the difference between the height of the left and the 
// right subtree for each node is either 0 or 1.

// pre, post and inorder traversals are DFS (Depth first search) algos
// level order traversals are BFS (Breadth first search) algos

Applications of binary trees
Binary Search Tree - Used in many search applications where data is constantly entering/leaving, such as the map and set objects in many languages' libraries.
Binary Space Partition - Used in almost every 3D video game to determine what objects need to be rendered.
Binary Tries - Used in almost every high-bandwidth router for storing router-tables.
Hash Trees - Used in torrents and specialized image-signatures in which a hash needs to be verified, but the whole file is not available. Also used in blockchains for eg. Bitcoin.
Heaps - Used in implementing efficient priority-queues, which in turn are used for scheduling processes in many operating systems, Quality-of-Service in routers, and A* (path-finding algorithm used in AI applications, including robotics and video games). Also used in heap-sort.
Huffman Coding Tree (Chip Uni) - Used in compression algorithms, such as those used by the .jpeg and .mp3 file-formats.
GGM Trees - Used in cryptographic applications to generate a tree of pseudo-random numbers.
Syntax Tree - Constructed by compilers and (implicitly) calculators to parse expressions.
Treap - Randomized data structure used in wireless networking and memory allocation.
T-tree - Though most databases use some form of B-tree to store data on the drive, databases which keep all (most) their data in memory often use T-trees to do so.
