//block
{
    //compound statement
}

// block is combined with if,for,while etc etc

// a block is created where we want to use multiple statements in place of single statement

if(true) console.log("is valid")

// now when you want to execute multiple statements you wrap them up in block statement 



// let and const are BLOCK SCOPED i.e they are not accessible outside the blocks like variables 
// in any other programming langugae
