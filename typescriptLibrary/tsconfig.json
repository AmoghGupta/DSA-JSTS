// You need to add the "declaration": true flag. This will generate the .d.ts files (aka declaration files) which contain the types of your code.
// This way, if someone is using your library and they also use TypeScript, they get the benefits of typesafety and autocomplete!

// The module compiler option "module": "commonjs" is required if you want your code to run seamlessly with most current node.js applications.

// "target": "es2015" specifies which version of JavaScript your code will get transpiled to.

// Choosing es2015 as the compile target makes your library compatible with node.js version 8 and upwards. 
// "outDir": "./dist" will write your compiled files into the dist folder and the include option specifies where your source code lives.
