It’s a complete tree (All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible). 

Important: This property of Binary Heap makes them suitable to be stored in an array.

Heaps - 
1. Used in implementing efficient priority-queues, which in turn are used for scheduling processes in many operating systems.
2. Quality-of-Service in routers, and A* (path-finding algorithm used in AI applications, including robotics and video games).XWW


Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. 
The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.

Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. 
The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
