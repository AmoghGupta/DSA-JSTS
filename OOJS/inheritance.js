// Prototype-based Inheritance
// Prototype is important in JavaScript because JavaScript does not have classical inheritance based on Classes 
// (as most object oriented languages do), and therefore all inheritance in JavaScript is made possible through the prototype property. 

function Plant () {
    this.country = "Mexico";
    this.isOrganic = true;
}
    
// Add the showNameAndColor method to the Plant prototype property
Plant.prototype.showNameAndColor =  function () {
    console.log("I am a " + this.name + " and my color is " + this.color);
}

// Add the amIOrganic method to the Plant prototype property
Plant.prototype.amIOrganic = function () {
    if (this.isOrganic)
    console.log("I am organic, Baby!");
}

function Fruit (fruitName, fruitColor) {
    this.name = fruitName;
    this.color = fruitColor;
}

// Set the Fruit's prototype to Plant's constructor, thus inheriting all of Plant.prototype methods and properties.
Fruit.prototype = new Plant ();

// Creates a new object, aBanana, with the Fruit constructor
var aBanana = new Fruit ("Banana", "Yellow");

// Here, aBanana uses the name property from the aBanana object prototype, which is Fruit.prototype:
console.log(aBanana.name); // Banana

// Uses the showNameAndColor method from the Fruit object prototype, which is Plant.prototype. The aBanana object inherits all the properties and methods from both the Plant and Fruit functions.
console.log(aBanana.showNameAndColor()); // I am a Banana and my color is yellow.
