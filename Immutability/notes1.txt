Primitive types in JavaScript are:
strings
undefined
null is a special primitive type. If you run typeof null you’ll get 'object' back, but it’s actually a primitive type.
Symbol values
booleans (true or false)
numbers (Number and BigInt)

Everything that is not a primitive type is an object.Functions are objects, too.

Primitive types are immutable, but objects are mutable their value can change over time.
Primitive values are immutable — they cannot be changed after being created. 

Object references, however, are mutable and can be changed. Objects can be made immutable.
Component State/Props is an immutable object.
State/Props should not have a multi-level nested object.
React: compares values when looking at primitive data types, and compares references for objects.

In JavaScript, only objects and arrays are mutable, not primitive values.
